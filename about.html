		My name is Jedd Panopio and I am currently an Art major at San Jose State University. I have worked on a variety of projects in different mediums ranging from digital illustrations to photography. My tools of choice are Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. As for my work, I don't have a set style because of the different mediums I have worked in, but I like to create art that I find interesting such as creating landscapes with an emphasis on bright colors and line work. I like creating work in different mediums because it is a great way to experiement with a plethora of styles and to create something new and different.
