      <p>My name is Jedd Panopio. I am a multimedia artist, designer and developer. I am an Art major at San Jose State University. My current occupation is a Print and Marketing Associate at Staples. Some of my hobbies include watching anime and playing video games with friends. My work consists of artwork in different mediums including digital illustration, game design and photography.</p>

       <p> Since I create art from different mediums, I try to create incorporate what kind of style I would have according to my medium. Not having one set style is difficult, but I believe it keeps the artworks interesting to work on.</p>
