      <p> Jedd was born on June 30th 1998, in the Philippines. He later moved to America with his family and settled in Arizona for 5 years. He later moved to California and is currently attending San Jose State University for his undergrad in Art. As soon as he entered college, Jedd dove into the world of art in his intro digital media art class. From that point, he fell in love with the class and wanted to pursue the course further, with the intent of becoming a videogame designer/developer. Jedd works with tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator but also has experience with game design and web design. He creates 2D landscapes and environments with the use of colors and geometric shapes. Jedd was a winner in the recent Pandemic Pandemonium in the category Media Arts for his Social Distancing App Website.

       <h3 class="portfolio-resume-header">Artist Statement</h3>
      <p> 

I am an interdisciplinary artist who works with digital art using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. My artwork falls into digital art but I have experience with other mediums such as game design and web design. A majority of my art focuses on the subject of 2D landscape and environments and uses a plethora of colors and geometric shapes with the intent of giving peaceful and  ambient vibes. I work with landscape because it allows me to experiment with style and use a combination of colors. The vision for my art is to create something for myself in which I can reflect and see my overall progress in learning new things. I create art I am proud of, whatever the concept may be. I want the audience viewing my work to not only appreciate the work itself but to acknowledge the elements of the art piece such as the colors or shapes. My intent with my artwork is for the viewer to always appreciate their surroundings. As of right now, I am currently exploring new ways I can integrate the world of 3D into my vision of landscapes and environments and bring it life. I want to create a diversity of work with these mediums to find ways to integrate them with each other and produce interesting work I can be proud of.
