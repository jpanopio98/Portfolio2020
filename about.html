      <h3 class="portfolio-resume-header">Biography</h3>
      <p>Jedd was born on June 30th 1998, in the Philippines. He later moved to America with his family and settled in Arizona for 5 years. He then moved to California and is currently attending San Jose State University for his undergrad in Art. As soon as he entered college, Jedd dove into the world of art in his intro digital media art class. From that point, he fell in love with the class and wanted to pursue the course further, with the intent of becoming a video game designer/developer. Jedd finds inspiration for his art from his experiences in the internet and the video games he plays. His love ofr the immersive worlds he plays convinced him to create art from his imagination. He wants to use his skills with the various software hes learned to creating interesting and immersive art.  </p>

       <h3 class="portfolio-resume-header">Artist Statement</h3>
      <p>My overall vision for my art is to create something for myself in which I can reflect in and see my overall progress in learning new things. I want to create art I am proud of, whatever the concept may be. I want the audience viewing my work to not only appreciate the work itself but to acknowledge elements of the body of work such as use of color or shapes. My artwork fall into numerous mediums inlcuding website design and game design. I want to create a diversity of work with these mediums to find ways to integrate them with each other and produce interesting work. </p>
